# java-torrent-search

This is a torrent-search library which i will use in an upcoming project of mine. It uses a Torrent Class and RSS Parser class to match rss fields into the Torrent Class Fields therefore making it easy to write bots for torrent tracker sites which has rss.

In the upcoming updates, i will implement an interface to make filtered searches on each site. Giving options like category and time based searches. I'm thinking of a way to implement filtered searches so both KickassTO and NyaaEU will have advanced search options same with their sites.
