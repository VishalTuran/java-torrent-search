# java-torrent-search

This is a torrent-search library which i will use in an upcoming project of mine. It uses a [Torrent](src/com/yengas/torrent/Torrent.java) Class and a [RSS Parser](src/com/yengas/torrent/utilities/TorrentFeedParser.java) class to match rss fields into the Torrent Class Fields therefore making it easy to write bots for torrent tracker sites which has rss.

In the upcoming updates, i will implement an interface to make filtered searches on each site. Giving options like category and time based searches. I'm thinking of a way to implement filtered searches so both KickassTO and NyaaEU will have advanced search options same with their sites.
